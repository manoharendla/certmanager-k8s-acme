    title Cert-Manager ACME v2 Client on Kubernetes with Vault ACME Server, PKI Engine, and Venafi Policy Governance

    %% Define Participants
    participant K8sClient as Cert-Manager ACME Client (K8s Cluster)
    participant Vault as HashiCorp Vault (ACME Server + PKI Engine)
    participant Venafi as Venafi Policy Governance Engine
    participant DNS as DNS Provider (for DNS-01 challenge)
    participant K8sSecret as Kubernetes Secret Store

    %% Step-by-Step Process with Autonumbering
    autonumber

    %% Step 1: Cert-Manager initiates certificate request to Vault (ACME server)
    K8sClient ->> Vault: Create Order (CSR with domain names)
    Vault ->> Venafi: Request Policy Compliance Check for CSR and Domain

    %% Step 2: Venafi validates compliance with policy rules
    Venafi ->> Venafi: Verify CSR and domain against policy requirements
    Venafi ->> Vault: Respond with compliance status and permitted challenge type

    %% Step 3: Vault provides ACME challenge to Cert-Manager
    Vault ->> K8sClient: Respond with Order ID, pending status, and ACME challenge (DNS-01/HTTP-01)

    %% Step 4: Cert-Manager sets up the ACME challenge
    alt DNS-01 Challenge
        K8sClient ->> DNS: Create DNS TXT record (_acme-challenge.<domain>)
        Vault ->> DNS: Query DNS for TXT record validation
    else HTTP-01 Challenge
        K8sClient ->> K8sClient: Serve HTTP challenge file in specified path
        Vault ->> K8sClient: Request HTTP challenge file for verification
    end

    %% Step 5: Vault validates the challenge
    Vault ->> K8sClient: ACME Challenge Validated (Domain Ownership Proven)

    %% Step 6: Vault issues the certificate using its PKI engine
    Vault ->> Vault: Generate Certificate (signed by Vault PKI CA)
    Vault ->> K8sSecret: Store issued certificate in Kubernetes Secret Store

    %% Step 7: Cert-Manager retrieves the certificate from Kubernetes Secret
    K8sClient ->> K8sSecret: Retrieve issued certificate for application use

    %% Step 8: Venafi monitors issued certificates for compliance
    loop Ongoing Compliance Audit
        Venafi ->> Vault: Periodic audit request for issued certificate details
        Vault ->> Venafi: Provide certificate issuance logs and details
    end

    %% Step 9: Renewal Process
    loop Certificate Expiry Monitoring
        K8sClient ->> K8sClient: Monitor certificate expiry in K8s Secret
        K8sClient ->> Vault: Request certificate renewal before expiry
        Vault ->> Venafi: Verify policy compliance for renewal request
        Vault ->> K8sSecret: Issue renewed certificate to Kubernetes Secret Store
    end

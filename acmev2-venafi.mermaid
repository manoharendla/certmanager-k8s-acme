    title ACME v2 Client to Venafi ACME Server: Certificate Automation Process

    %% Define Participants
    participant Client as ACME v2 Client
    participant ACME as Venafi ACME Server
    participant DNS as DNS Provider (for DNS-01 challenge)
    participant CertDB as Venafi Certificate Database

    %% Step-by-Step Process with Detailed Steps
    autonumber

    %% Client initiates certificate request
    Client ->> ACME: Create Order (domain names)
    ACME ->> ACME: Validate Order parameters (check domain names)
    ACME ->> Client: Respond with Order ID and pending status

    %% ACME Server sends a challenge for domain ownership
    Client ->> ACME: Request for challenge
    ACME ->> Client: Respond with DNS-01/HTTP-01 challenge

    %% Client configures DNS or HTTP server based on challenge type
    alt DNS-01 Challenge
        Client ->> DNS: Add DNS TXT record (_acme-challenge.<domain>)
        ACME ->> DNS: Query DNS for TXT record
    else HTTP-01 Challenge
        Client ->> Client: Setup HTTP server to respond to ACME challenge
        ACME ->> Client: Request for HTTP challenge file
    end

    %% ACME Server verifies the challenge
    ACME ->> Client: ACME Challenge Validation success

    %% Client finalizes the order
    Client ->> ACME: Finalize Order (CSR submission)
    ACME ->> ACME: Validate CSR and finalize order

    %% Venafi server issues the certificate
    ACME ->> CertDB: Generate certificate and store in Venafi Database
    CertDB -->> ACME: Certificate ready

    %% ACME Server provides certificate to client
    ACME ->> Client: Issue Certificate

    %% Client downloads the certificate and stores it locally
    Client ->> Client: Download and store certificate locally

    %% Automation for Renewal Process
    loop Certificate Expiry Check
        Client ->> Client: Check certificate expiry
        Client ->> ACME: Re-initiate certificate request if near expiry
    end
